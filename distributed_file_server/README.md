### This folder contains the program for a distributed file server implemented in c++
Our file server is divided into two modules:
1. **Client module**
1. **Server module**

Various features of our file servers are:
1. Secure transfer of files from server to the client upon request.
1. Caching of files at client module to minimize the traffic to the server.
1. Using a timestamp based approach to solve the cache-coherence problem.
